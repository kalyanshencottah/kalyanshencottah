I am Kalyan Shencottah. My experiences are in SAP (Basis Administration, Upgrades, System Refresh, Service Desk) and in Oracle (ER Modeling, DB Administration, Development). 
My goal in Consulting is to help Customers improve performances of their Systems either by using EWA (Early Watch Analysis), Work Load Analysis(ST05), DB Storage Forecast, DB Statistics, DB Query Cost Analysis and Query Optimization, Process scheduling and troubleshooting on ABAP, Java, Enterprise Portal issues and Interface issues.

With Computer Science background, I am also fascinated by Data Structures and Algorithms and their Complexity Analysis.  My approach towards problem-solving is to understand the data, ask right questions, formulating a Query, do literature survey and then work on finding a solution. First "What", then "How". Right now I am exploring Machine Learning using Python to gain deeper understanding of algorithms such as Classification, Regression, Clustering, Neural Networks(especially LSTM).

Programming experience include C, C++, Oracle Pro*C, SQL, PL/SQL, Java and Python(BioPython, GFFUtils, PyTorch, NumPy)

Corporate Experience: IBM(SAP Basis), Itelligence Consulting USA (SAP Basis), TCS(Oracle)

Academic Degrees: MSc Professional ITBusiness and Digitalization (Oct 2023-Present) - HTW Berlin, MS(Information Systems) - U of Cincinnati(2008), MS(Computer Science) - U of Cincinnati(2007)
Masters Thesis : Finding Clusters in Spatial Data, 2007, U of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA
